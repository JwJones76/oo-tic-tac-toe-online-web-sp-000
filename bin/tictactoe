>* I want to mention few differences between my code & Learn.co:

```Ruby
def full?
  @board.all? {|cell| cell == "X" || cell == "O"}
end

def full?
   @board.all?{|square| square != " " }
end
```
>>* Instead of doing a comparison for each cell, I can say if cell not equal to empty.

>* A part of `#play` method could be refactored as following:

Learn.co code:

```Ruby
puts winner ? "Congratulations #{winner}!" : "Cat's Game!"
```

Instead of my code:

```Ruby
if won?
  puts "Congratulations #{winner}!"
elsif draw?
  puts "Cat's Game!"
end
